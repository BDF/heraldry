# heraldry

A very small body of code to parse heraldry blazons.   A blazon is 'a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon).   It will never be 'perfect' since there is so much variation in blazons.
